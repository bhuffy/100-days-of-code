# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Restarted Free Code Camp's front end curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I hadn't consistently, so I forgot the intro stuff I worked on a few months ago and scattered things I've learned throughout the last half year (I previously did the first 27 or so on the FCC map, so it only shows 1 new item). Today I was able to get through 28, and many of the elements and whatnot are coming back to me.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I continued FCC's front end curriculum in HTML and CSS. On track to finish section tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: It's going fairly well and today was all new material. I've also started creating a sheet on Evernote for notes on things to remember (a reference guide/cheat sheet of sorts). I felt that much progress was made today!

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML & CSS section of Free Code Camp (the first 5 hour section).

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying the process of learning so far. Everthing that I've learned hasn't been difficult or taken more than a minute or two to figure out for each section. I'm excited to see what the next section on responsive design with boostrap will have in store.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: I started the bootstrap portion of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** I enjoyed my first day learning Bootstrap. I progressed at a much slower rate compared to previous days on HTML and CSS (even though they seem relatively similar to me), but part of that is due to research on why frameworks are useful and how Bootstrap helps. I'm hoping I'll gather a basic understanding of how things are related and why they are used, especially early on.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Free Code Camp's bootstrap portion. 

**Thoughts** Some of the code is getting a bit more challenging, but still relatively straight forward. I can tell that I'm slowly being expected to remember concepts and navigate more code. I'm a bit worried that I won't be able to remember all of this without reminders (or a lot of practice). I'm also excited because I'm on track to be starting the Free Code Camp basic front end development projects this coming week! Let's see how it all turns out. :)
