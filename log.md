# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Restarted Free Code Camp's front end curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I hadn't consistently, so I forgot the intro stuff I worked on a few months ago and scattered things I've learned throughout the last half year (I previously did the first 27 or so on the FCC map, so it only shows 1 new item). Today I was able to get through 28, and many of the elements and whatnot are coming back to me.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I continued FCC's front end curriculum in HTML and CSS. On track to finish section tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: It's going fairly well and today was all new material. I've also started creating a sheet on Evernote for notes on things to remember (a reference guide/cheat sheet of sorts). I felt that much progress was made today!

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML & CSS section of Free Code Camp (the first 5 hour section).

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying the process of learning so far. Everthing that I've learned hasn't been difficult or taken more than a minute or two to figure out for each section. I'm excited to see what the next section on responsive design with boostrap will have in store.
