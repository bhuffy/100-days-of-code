# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Restarted Free Code Camp's front end curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I hadn't consistently, so I forgot the intro stuff I worked on a few months ago and scattered things I've learned throughout the last half year (I previously did the first 27 or so on the FCC map, so it only shows 1 new item). Today I was able to get through 28, and many of the elements and whatnot are coming back to me.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I continued FCC's front end curriculum in HTML and CSS. On track to finish section tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: It's going fairly well and today was all new material. I've also started creating a sheet on Evernote for notes on things to remember (a reference guide/cheat sheet of sorts). I felt that much progress was made today!

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML & CSS section of Free Code Camp (the first 5 hour section).

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying the process of learning so far. Everthing that I've learned hasn't been difficult or taken more than a minute or two to figure out for each section. I'm excited to see what the next section on responsive design with boostrap will have in store.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: I started the bootstrap section of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** I enjoyed my first day learning Bootstrap. I progressed at a much slower rate compared to previous days on HTML and CSS (even though they seem relatively similar to me), but part of that is due to research on why frameworks are useful and how Bootstrap helps. I'm hoping I'll gather a basic understanding of how things are related and why they are used, especially early on.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Free Code Camp's bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts** Some of the code is getting a bit more challenging, but still relatively straight forward. I can tell that I'm slowly being expected to remember concepts and navigate more code. I'm a bit worried that I won't be able to remember all of this without reminders (or a lot of practice). I'm also excited because I'm on track to be starting the Free Code Camp basic front end development projects this coming week! Let's see how it all turns out. :)

### Day 6: January 8, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Started the jQuery section of Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts** Part of the process today was signing up for the forums and looking around. It seems like a great community of people who genuinely care about learning and software development. I was thinking about supplementing FCC's curriculum with other programs, but I'm not so sure I need that anymore. I didn't learn a ton today about code, but I'm understanding the process better.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Finished the jQuery section of FCC and set up CodePen.

**Thoughts** I'm somewhat impressed at how far I came today. I was mulling over the numbers to finish the certificates yesterday and realized it would take about two years if I stuck to my schedule which includes spending most of my summer on it. Considering I completed the jQuery section in a fraction of the suggested time without rushing (taking notes, actually), I'm not sure what to expect. I'm also a bit of a perfectionist, so I bet the project will take a while (I would also like them to look good!). Only time will tell. :)

### Day 8: January 10, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Started coding and researching for Tribute Page on CodePen.

**Thoughts** Hmm... I was a bit overwhelmed and didn't know where to start with a blank sheet. No instructions make the process a little harder. I tried not to look at anyone's code, but I looked at a few different pages and have a general plan on what I might make it look like. I've also realized that with so many tools its hard to pick out what the best practices are for situations, or how to organize my code in a way other developers can easily understand. Lastly, I'm interested in exploring HTML & CSS further because it seems like there's so much I don't know about HTML and CSS that I don't think I'll learn in FCC.
