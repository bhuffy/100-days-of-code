# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Restarted Free Code Camp's front end curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I hadn't consistently, so I forgot the intro stuff I worked on a few months ago and scattered things I've learned throughout the last half year (I previously did the first 27 or so on the FCC map, so it only shows 1 new item). Today I was able to get through 28, and many of the elements and whatnot are coming back to me.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I continued FCC's front end curriculum in HTML and CSS. On track to finish section tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: It's going fairly well and today was all new material. I've also started creating a sheet on Evernote for notes on things to remember (a reference guide/cheat sheet of sorts). I felt that much progress was made today!

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML & CSS section of Free Code Camp (the first 5 hour section).

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying the process of learning so far. Everthing that I've learned hasn't been difficult or taken more than a minute or two to figure out for each section. I'm excited to see what the next section on responsive design with boostrap will have in store.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: I started the bootstrap section of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** I enjoyed my first day learning Bootstrap. I progressed at a much slower rate compared to previous days on HTML and CSS (even though they seem relatively similar to me), but part of that is due to research on why frameworks are useful and how Bootstrap helps. I'm hoping I'll gather a basic understanding of how things are related and why they are used, especially early on.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Free Code Camp's bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts** Some of the code is getting a bit more challenging, but still relatively straight forward. I can tell that I'm slowly being expected to remember concepts and navigate more code. I'm a bit worried that I won't be able to remember all of this without reminders (or a lot of practice). I'm also excited because I'm on track to be starting the Free Code Camp basic front end development projects this coming week! Let's see how it all turns out. :)

### Day 6: January 8, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Started the jQuery section of Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts** Part of the process today was signing up for the forums and looking around. It seems like a great community of people who genuinely care about learning and software development. I was thinking about supplementing FCC's curriculum with other programs, but I'm not so sure I need that anymore. I didn't learn a ton today about code, but I'm understanding the process better.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Finished the jQuery section of FCC and set up CodePen.

**Thoughts** I'm somewhat impressed at how far I came today. I was mulling over the numbers to finish the certificates yesterday and realized it would take about two years if I stuck to my schedule which includes spending most of my summer on it. Considering I completed the jQuery section in a fraction of the suggested time without rushing (taking notes, actually), I'm not sure what to expect. I'm also a bit of a perfectionist, so I bet the project will take a while (I would also like them to look good!). Only time will tell. :)

### Day 8: January 10, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Started coding and researching for Tribute Page on CodePen.

**Thoughts** Hmm... I was a bit overwhelmed and didn't know where to start with a blank sheet. No instructions make the process a little harder. I tried not to look at anyone's code, but I looked at a few different pages and have a general plan on what I might make it look like. I've also realized that with so many tools its hard to pick out what the best practices are for situations, or how to organize my code in a way other developers can easily understand. Lastly, I'm interested in exploring HTML & CSS further because it seems like there's so much I don't know about HTML and CSS that I don't think I'll learn in FCC.

### Day 10: January 11, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tribute Page.

**Thoughts** Today I spent quite a lot of time revising my notes and code for some silly things I couldn't work out. For example, I didn't undertand why my image wasn't responsive (forgot to insert "img-responsive" class) and I had trouble with Google Fonts because I thought the link would be under the CSS instead of HTML. Anyway, I'm juuuuusst starting to get a feel for the general layout and process.

### Day 9: January 12, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tribute Page.

**Thoughts** Most of today was research and inserting content. Ray Kurzweil has a rich history... Overall today was smooth and I only ran into a few problems in terms of centering. I've decided to only use HTML for this project, so styling is a bit interesting. I expect I'll finish the tribute page in another day.

### Day 11: January 13, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tribute Page.

**Thoughts** I finished my first edition of the tribute page today. I intentionally made it minimalistic because I was avoiding using CSS and I also didn't want to use cheesy colors (though I did mess around with them a bit). I recently bought "HTML & CSS" by Jon Duckett, which I'll be reading the next few weeks while I construct my portfolio page and possibly revise the tribute page if I feel the need. I'm happy with my results so far.

### Day 12: January 14, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tribute Page.

**Thoughts** Ok, so here's the deal... today I looked at the next project: building a portfolio website. The website given has more functionality that I think I can perform. I also took a look at other tribute pages after I finished, and I realized that some people created web pages far more advanced than mine in only HTML and CSS! Granted it seems like the great ones had prior experience, but because I want to be particularly good at Front End development and FCC doesn't offer more information on HTML, CSS, or jQuery (the next part goes straight to Javascript) I've decided to read Jon Duckett's book on HTML & CSS while completing this next project. It's not that I can't build one with my current skills, but I want it to look more than acceptable; I want it to look <em>good</em>. I figure supplementing my progress towards the FCC certificates with other texts will help me in the long run. I need to focus on the quality of my products more than getting a certificate, right?

Anyway, the next few days I probably won't be doing anything except learning through the book. Plus, I read 35 pages today and now even have a basic understanding of how the web works as well as the "why" of using elements instead of just what they do. The functionality aspects are review so far, but I know there are elements that I haven't covered in FCC that I'll find in the book. The last 2 chapters on CSS and and the process of building websites for funcionality and practically look fun!

### Day 13: January 15, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: learned HTML & CSS from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts** I think once I finish the HTML section of the book I'll start the portfolio page (splitting half between learning CSS and coding on codepen.io). I browsed codepen and found some super awesome stuff today done only with HTML and CSS, which is a huge inspiration to learn more about HTML and CSS before moving onto Javascript. I suspect I won't finish the portfolio website until 1-2 weeks from now. Oh well... definitely having fun!

### Day 14: January 16, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: learned HTML & CSS from Jon Duckett's book, started Portfolio Page.

**Thoughts** I read through some more of the HTML & CSS book, but I also started the page the last 10 minutes because I figure I need to work or else I'll start forgetting some things. I learned a lot more about the structure of HTML and links today, including how I might organize a site map, which is useful for a portfolio page. Tomorrow I'll probably start splitting 50/50 with coding and the book.
