# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Restarted Free Code Camp's front end curriculum.

**Thoughts:** I hadn't consistently, so I forgot the intro stuff I worked on a few months ago and scattered things I've learned throughout the last half year (I previously did the first 27 or so on the FCC map, so it only shows 1 new item). Today I was able to get through 28, and many of the elements and whatnot are coming back to me.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: I continued FCC's front end curriculum in HTML and CSS. On track to finish section tomorrow!

**Thoughts**: It's going fairly well and today was all new material. I've also started creating a sheet on Evernote for notes on things to remember (a reference guide/cheat sheet of sorts). I felt that much progress was made today!

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML & CSS section of Free Code Camp (the first 5 hour section).

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying the process of learning so far. Everthing that I've learned hasn't been difficult or taken more than a minute or two to figure out for each section. I'm excited to see what the next section on responsive design with boostrap will have in store.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: I started the bootstrap section of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** I enjoyed my first day learning Bootstrap. I progressed at a much slower rate compared to previous days on HTML and CSS (even though they seem relatively similar to me), but part of that is due to research on why frameworks are useful and how Bootstrap helps. I'm hoping I'll gather a basic understanding of how things are related and why they are used, especially early on.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Free Code Camp's bootstrap section. 

**Thoughts** Some of the code is getting a bit more challenging, but still relatively straight forward. I can tell that I'm slowly being expected to remember concepts and navigate more code. I'm a bit worried that I won't be able to remember all of this without reminders (or a lot of practice). I'm also excited because I'm on track to be starting the Free Code Camp basic front end development projects this coming week! Let's see how it all turns out. :)

### Day 6: January 8, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Started the jQuery section of Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts** Part of the process today was signing up for the forums and looking around. It seems like a great community of people who genuinely care about learning and software development. I was thinking about supplementing FCC's curriculum with other programs, but I'm not so sure I need that anymore. I didn't learn a ton today about code, but I'm understanding the process better.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Finished the jQuery section of FCC and set up CodePen.

**Thoughts** I'm somewhat impressed at how far I came today. I was mulling over the numbers to finish the certificates yesterday and realized it would take about two years if I stuck to my schedule which includes spending most of my summer on it. Considering I completed the jQuery section in a fraction of the suggested time without rushing (taking notes, actually), I'm not sure what to expect. I'm also a bit of a perfectionist, so I bet the project will take a while (I would also like them to look good!). Only time will tell. :)

### Day 8: January 10, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Started coding and researching for Tribute Page on CodePen.

**Thoughts** Hmm... I was a bit overwhelmed and didn't know where to start with a blank sheet. No instructions make the process a little harder. I tried not to look at anyone's code, but I looked at a few different pages and have a general plan on what I might make it look like. I've also realized that with so many tools its hard to pick out what the best practices are for situations, or how to organize my code in a way other developers can easily understand. Lastly, I'm interested in exploring HTML & CSS further because it seems like there's so much I don't know about HTML and CSS that I don't think I'll learn in FCC.

### Day 10: January 11, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tribute Page.

**Thoughts** Today I spent quite a lot of time revising my notes and code for some silly things I couldn't work out. For example, I didn't undertand why my image wasn't responsive (forgot to insert "img-responsive" class) and I had trouble with Google Fonts because I thought the link would be under the CSS instead of HTML. Anyway, I'm juuuuusst starting to get a feel for the general layout and process.

### Day 9: January 12, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tribute Page.

**Thoughts** Most of today was research and inserting content. Ray Kurzweil has a rich history... Overall today was smooth and I only ran into a few problems in terms of centering. I've decided to only use HTML for this project, so styling is a bit interesting. I expect I'll finish the tribute page in another day.

### Day 11: January 13, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tribute Page.

**Thoughts** I finished my first edition of the tribute page today. I intentionally made it minimalistic because I was avoiding using CSS and I also didn't want to use cheesy colors (though I did mess around with them a bit). I recently bought "HTML & CSS" by Jon Duckett, which I'll be reading the next few weeks while I construct my portfolio page and possibly revise the tribute page if I feel the need. I'm happy with my results so far.

### Day 12: January 14, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tribute Page.

**Thoughts** Ok, so here's the deal... today I looked at the next project: building a portfolio website. The website given has more functionality that I think I can perform. I also took a look at other tribute pages after I finished, and I realized that some people created web pages far more advanced than mine in only HTML and CSS! Granted it seems like the great ones had prior experience, but because I want to be particularly good at Front End development and FCC doesn't offer more information on HTML, CSS, or jQuery (the next part goes straight to Javascript) I've decided to read Jon Duckett's book on HTML & CSS while completing this next project. It's not that I can't build one with my current skills, but I want it to look more than acceptable; I want it to look <em>good</em>. I figure supplementing my progress towards the FCC certificates with other texts will help me in the long run. I need to focus on the quality of my products more than getting a certificate, right?

Anyway, the next few days I probably won't be doing anything except learning through the book. Plus, I read 35 pages today and now even have a basic understanding of how the web works as well as the "why" of using elements instead of just what they do. The functionality aspects are review so far, but I know there are elements that I haven't covered in FCC that I'll find in the book. The last 2 chapters on CSS and and the process of building websites for funcionality and practically look fun!

### Day 13: January 15, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned HTML & CSS from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: I think once I finish the HTML section of the book I'll start the portfolio page (splitting half between learning CSS and coding on codepen.io). I browsed codepen and found some super awesome stuff today done only with HTML and CSS, which is a huge inspiration to learn more about HTML and CSS before moving onto Javascript. I suspect I won't finish the portfolio website until 1-2 weeks from now. Oh well... definitely having fun!

### Day 14: January 16, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned HTML & CSS from Jon Duckett's book, started Portfolio Page.

**Thoughts**: I read through some more of the HTML & CSS book, but I also started the page the last 10 minutes because I figure I need to work or else I'll start forgetting some things. I learned a lot more about the structure of HTML and links today, including how I might organize a site map, which is useful for a portfolio page. Tomorrow I'll probably start splitting 50/50 with coding and the book.

### Day 15: January 17, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned HTML & CSS from Jon Duckett's book, experimented with Portfolio Page.

**Thoughts**: I read through even more of the HTML & CSS book, and experimented a little by adding an id attribute to link to different parts of my page (not going to make different ones for my portfolio, just one). I ran into a bit of trouble but I might use buttons instead. I think I might need 2-3 more days of learning the HTML section before I'm done with that, and by that point I'll probably put together the structure of the portfolio page as well. I might set aside a day to create content for it (gather images, text, outline). I definitely recommend the book though, it's so helpful! Might buy his book on Javascript and jQuery for the next unit when I start javascript, but I probably shouldn't get too far ahead of myself...

### Day 16: January 18, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned HTML from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: Being super tired today (coasting on 4.5 hours sleep), it's been hard focusing, so I've just been compiling notes and learning new stuff that I can review later. I should probably sleep and do more hours tomorrow, but that wouldn't comply with the challenge, and constistency is key... tomorrow will hopefully be a day of actual coding. :)

**Link(s) to work**: NONE



### Day 17: January 19, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned HTML from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: Today was alright. It's my birthday, but it feels pretty normal. I spent today learning about different forms in HTML and their attributes. It's astounding how much information there is. I'm going to definitely create quizlet flashcards when I finish the HTML section. I think I'll finish the HTML section in 2 days or less. Then I'll be coding the website as I read the CSS section. It doesn't worry me that I've spent 5 hours or so learning HTML & CSS from the book because I've plowed through the hours on FreeCodeCamp and the Tribute page + Personal Portfolio are supposed to take 50 hours. Putting that into perspective, an extra 10-15 hours learning HTML and CSS before coding the rest means I'll still probably finish with well under that amount, and I know they're using things in the example page that isn't taught on the site. Overall decent day, excited for tomorrow. I'm sure coding when I'm 17 will be just as exciting.

### Day 18: January 20, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned HTML from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: Went over form controls today. The book displays them all on separate page, but listing them out next to each other definitely helped me see the connections between elements. I'm incredibly tired again today, but still enjoying it all.

**Link(s) to work**: NONE



### Day 19: January 21, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: About finished HTML from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: I'm aaaaaalmost done with Jon Duckett's HTML portion. I'm thinking I'll focus more on learning flash with Javascript for videos, especially because the book's using the script element and I'd like to know what all the information I'm pasting for encoding a video, etc. means. I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I at least I have a solid foundation. Maybe some review and organization tomorrow before I keep coding the portfolio page.

**Link(s) to work**: NONE



### Day 20: January 22, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML section.

**Thoughts**: So today I finished up the HTML section of the book and started the CSS portion. I'm especially excited for this part because CSS is where I have the most shortcomings where I can really transform my page. Can't wait!

**Link(s) to work**: NONE



### Day 21: January 23, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book, some experimentation in CodePen.

**Thoughts**: I mostly went through CSS today getting an intro to how it works. I think understanding the hierarchy and overall layout will be a bit difficult to understand, especially in practice. I guess it just takes time, and besides, I haven't really used it much yet!

### Day 22: January 24, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book, some experimentation in CodePen.

**Thoughts**: So today was color day in CSS, so I tried replicating the CSS pH scale in the book with hex code just to familiarize myself with the colors and how hex works (no prior knowledge). I had to check the code afterward and realized the book gave a much more intuitive way to do it, although I decided to keep hex instead of rgb. Tomorrow will be text day, so I'll probably work on the portfolio page. It's about time I continue developing it anyhow... content with today. :)

### Day 23: January 25, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book, some experimentation in CodePen.

**Thoughts**: While CSS seems daunting so far (learning many new things not introduced in freeCodeCamp), I love seeing all the daily CSS images and it's super inspiring. I definitely want to learn more of it. I'm slowly discovering just how extensive these languages are...

### Day 24: January 26, 2017 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: Looking at getting some books solely on CSS... going to finish the current HTML & CSS book first, but I really enjoy it so far. I'm probably going to put together flashcards for all of these properties, selectors, etc. though because I'm nearly certain this information will fade unless I start building websites immediately, which still probably won't be enough to retain everything. Or perhaps I just feel this way because it's so much new information. Who knows?

**Link(s) to work**: NONE



### Day 25: January 27, 2017 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: Did this one really late... 6 minutes until tomorrow. I spent most of my session passively learning in a drowsy state. I'll probably have to review everything when I wake up haha...

**Link(s) to work**: NONE



### Day 26: January 28, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book, experimenting on personal portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: Feeling awake enough today to experiment with the portfolio page. I might skip over to the layout portion of the book, because I still don't understand how to make a proper header that links down the page. It's a bit frustrating, because that's the main part that's been holding me back, but it must be in the back of the book because Duckett mentioned having the previous knowledge before starting. I'm not sure what my thoughts are but I might finish the project this week!

### Day 27: January 29, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book, created form experiment project.

**Thoughts**: Today I started learning about CSS for forms, tables, and lists. I struggle the most understanding forms and inputs because there's a lot of information, so I decided to try making a form with a new project on CodePen. I have to make on anyway for my portfolio website, so I might as well familiarize myself more by using the information. I haven't really done much with it yet because I started in the last 10 minutes, but we'll try to make it look good!

### Day 28: January 30, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with forms project.

**Thoughts**: Today I practically just messed around with forms and tried to create my own. It's very similar to the model done in Jon Duckett's book (I peeked at some of his code) but I made it relatively different. I didn't even read a page today, though I know I'm only a few pages away from the layout portion, which means I'll be building my portfolio soon. The one weird problem I had today was trying out boostrap after I'd already been working on the project. It really changed things up, so I decided to get rid of it. That might be a problem if I use bootstrap for the portfolio website... nevertheless, I'm excited for tomorrow.

### Day 29: January 31, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: Today (yesterday) I only did 20 minutes, though the minutes will still carry so I have more to tomorrow. I started the layout section of Jon Duckett's book (section III). This next section is on layout, so I'll probably just have to review everything a few times over to keep getting the terms, properties, methods, etc. in my mind.

### Day 30: February 1, 2017 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: Today I spend quite a bit of time experimenting with positioning. Conceptually I understand it but it's somewhat difficult in pratice, or at least integrating it into an existing project. I wasn't as productive today either...

**Link(s) to work**: NONE



### Day 31-32: February 2-3, 2017 (Thursday & Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Learned CSS from Jon Duckett's book, experimented with personal portfolio website.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday was busy so I only did scattered learning on Enki (mobile app that teaches programming) and today was able to code and read. I decided to clump these two days together since I don't really know just how much time I spent yesterday and it wasn't a complete day. Anyway, I'm finally figuring out how to work the personal portfolio website. Now that I'm almost done with Jon Duckett's book I'm not familiar with Boostrap or jQuery that much anymore... maybe I'll have to review those. Or maybe I won't use boostrap for this project. I'll be finishing the layout portion of the book and hopefully some background image stuff. I'm thinking about making a gradient background for the website, but if not I have the colors picked out!

### Day 33: February 4, 2017 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Finished layout section from Jon Duckett's book, addressing header/navigation problems on website.

**Thoughts**: Finished up the layout section of Jon Duckett's book. This means I only have the images, html5, and design process chapters left! I might spend quite a bit of time reviewing afterwards, or reread the book at some point in the near future to solidify all of the jumbled up knowledge swimming around my head. I spend a great deal of time today trying to figure out the header navigation system. I can't seem to get the h1 element and navigation aligned. I've never seen anyone use a table for it, but the book did use a grid with the 960.gs framework. Not sure what to do but doing research online...

### Day 34: February 5, 2017 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Applied to FCC Chingu cohort & learned about background images in book.

**Thoughts**: Today wasn't much coding, but I'm glad I spent time planning out my future of coding. I don't think I want to do this for a job, per-se, but certainly want to make stuff with it in my free time. It will certainly come in handy when I enter the startup world. Good, interesting, busy day.

**Link(s) to work**: NONE



### Day 35: February 6, 2017 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Worked with images & heaer on portfolio website, learnedin Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: I spend the majority of my day today trying to figure out how the header is supposed to work, and a little bit of learning HTML5 from Jon Duckett's book. I'll finish the book in another few days, but I'm spending more time just trying to figure out the site. Maybe I should have (or should?) start from scratch, because it's not going well and I'm much more organized. Or perhaps I'll just keep going at it. At least it's good practice.

**Link(s) to work**: NONE



### Day 36: February 7, 2017 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Read Process & Design section of Jon Duckett's book.

**Thoughts**: I felt today was somehow slow even though it seems like I read quite a lot. I'm feeling good about the application for this section beacuse it seems like my ideas generally follow the advice given. Perhaps my previous design experiences somehow relate...? :)
